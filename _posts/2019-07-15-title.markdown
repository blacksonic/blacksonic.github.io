Webstorm is an exceptionally good IDE for web development.
Webstorm has a keyboard shortcut for nearly every action, from interacting with code to UI interactions.
It is a professional IDE and the sheer number of shortcuts can make you feel overwhelmed.
The default keyboard shortcuts for Mac is [way over 100+](https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/webstorm/docs/WebStorm_ReferenceCard_macOS.pdf) (and you can define even more).
This is why I collected the my used and time saving shortcuts along with some advices in this article. 

Although it has a subscription model to use, you can also opt-in for the Early Access Program and use it for free.
